        The Guide This guide will help you get started with a Bootstrap Theme,
        including how to run, customize, update, and integrate your theme! Run
        your theme So you’ve downloaded your theme’s .zip file, unpacked it, and
        you’re ready to start building! To view your theme, you’ll need to run
        your theme’s "build process" to compile source files and create a local
        server to preview pages. Note: Some themes come with a directory of
        already compiled files for your convenience, but you’ll still want to
        run your theme’s build tool to serve the compiled files and avoid your
        local filesystem’s limitations. Setting up local development We allow
        each theme creator to select their own tooling and commands since each
        theme has different needs, so always to refer to your theme’s
        documentation for the actual commands and installation instructions.That
        said, the basic process of setting up local development is roughly the
        same in every theme: Install a theme’s dependencies from your command
        line via npm. (i.e. npm install) Run a "watch" or "build" command
        powered by Gulp, Grunt, or Webpack build tools. (i.e. npm start or gulp)
        Open your browser to your local server’s address (i.e. open Chrome to
        localhost:3000) Edit source files and preview changes instantly with
        live reload If the list above sounds like a foreign language to you,
        that’s okay! Let’s break it down: npm stands for node package manager.
        Npm is a tool to automate the process of installing and upgrading
        packages of code required to properly run your theme locally – that’s
        why they’re called dependencies! If you don’t have Node installed (which
        now contains npm), you’ll need to download and install it. Gulp, Grunt,
        and Webpack (build tools) are JavaScript libraries used to compile a
        theme’s source files and create a local server. Each library has
        different syntax and capabilities and it’s up to each author which
        library they prefer to use. They all achieve the same result end result:
        allow us to compile source files and view those changes immediately in a
        browser. A local server is a temporary server environment on your
        computer generated by your theme’s build tool. This avoids browser
        limitations of serving files directly from your computer’s filesystem
        (i.e. CORS limitations). Live reload is a convenience functionality that
        many themes will include as part of their build tooling. It simply means
        that when you edit source files, after they are recompiled, your browser
        will magically refresh and display the changes without a manual refresh.
        What are source, compiled and static files? These terms are can mean
        different things in different contexts, but for the purposes of a
        Bootstrap Theme: Source files are files that are meant to be processed
        by a theme’s build tools. Compiled files are generated as a result of
        running a compiling process (also called a "build process") on the
        source files. Static files are ones that aren’t processed or generated.
        Here are a few real world examples of each type of file: SCSS files are
        always source files because they must be compiled by your theme’s build
        tool to generate a CSS file that a browser can understand. HTML files
        with any non-standard syntax are source files. Some themes make use of
        libraries to create "includes" for elements shared across multiple
        pages. These includes must be compiled by your theme’s build tool to
        generate standard HTML. The output of both the above examples are
        compiled files. The CSS files are generated by processing the source
        SCSS. The HTML files are generated by processing the pseudo-HTML source.
        Both were generated from source files and will be overwritten if source
        is compiled again. Fonts, images, and standard HTML are static files.
        These don’t require any processing to be used and aren’t generated from
        any other source. That said, some themes may process images to optimize
        their size, in which case they would then be source files. Get it? The
        build process visualized Here’s what the whole build process looks like
        at a high level starting from source files and ending with a rendered
        theme page in your browser!
